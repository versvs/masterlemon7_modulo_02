# How to use

These exercises require npm and parcel as dependencies. 
Once you have npm installed and this repo cloned, go to the root folder of the project and run `npm install` to populate the node_modules folder with the required packages.

After that, the four exercises can be run using simple npm scripts like:

```
npm run uno
npm run dos
npm run tres
npm run cuatro
```
To see the details of what these scripts do, check the package.json.
